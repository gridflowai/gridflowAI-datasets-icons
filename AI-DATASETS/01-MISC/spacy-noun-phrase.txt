spaCy is an open-source software library for advanced Natural Language Processing, written in the programming languages Python and Cython. The library is published under the MIT license and currently offers statistical neural network models for English, German, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, Dutch and multi-language NER, as well as tokenization for various other languages.
spaCy v2.0 features new neural models for tagging, parsing and entity recognition. The models have been designed and implemented from scratch specifically for spaCy, to give you an unmatched balance of speed, size and accuracy.
Convolutional layers with residual connections, layer normalization and maxout non-linearity are used, giving much better efficiency than the standard BiLSTM solution.
